<b>NETWORK SECURITY ASSIGNMENT</b><br><br>
<b>PART ONE</b><br>
<b>1) Considering what you have learned through the course, how would you describe the process of User Authentication on a website by having three different factors of authentication?</b><br><br>
Websites use Client and Server technology. For a website that has some form of login for the user to be authorized (process of giving permission or access rights or privileges to the user) before they can be allowed to access their resource on the page, they need to be authenticated.
The process of authentication involves:<br>
a) The user needs to input their username and password. This process can only be known by the user and as such, it is one of the three methods of authentication known as <b>Something you Know â€“ (Knowledge Factors)</b>.<br><br>
b) If the username and password match the credentials in the database, a security token can be sent to his or her device for further verification before authorization for a resource can be granted. This security token is usually in the form of 6 digits which the user must input into the device. This is another method of authentication known as <b>Something that you Own (Ownership Factor)</b>. It is recommended that owners of websites that require a user to be authenticated use the multi-factor authentication technology e.g., 2FA (2 Factor Authentication) to add an extra layer of security during the user registration process and to maintain using the same during the login process.
